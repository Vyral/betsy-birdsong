One of the most common questions asked of real estate professionals is, “Am I better off buying or renting a home?”

The answer largely depends on your circumstances. **There are certain situations where you’d be far better off to rent a home as opposed to purchasing one outright.** That might sound crazy for a real estate agent to say, but it’s true\! For example, if you’re moving to a new area where you only plan to live for two years or fewer, then I’d seriously consider renting.&nbsp;

However, if you’re moving to a new area where you know you’ll live for three years or more, I know some people who are thinking of buying a home are really worried about the ups and downs of the market or whether they’ll lose money when it comes time to sell later on, but here’s the thing: In the long-term, homeownership always trends upward.

If you were to rent a home for three years and pay $2,000 per month, you’re guaranteed to lose $72,000. On the other hand, it’s very rare in the Greater New Orleans Area that you’ll ever lose $72,000 on any home that you purchase. Put another way, renting over the long-term is a guarantee that you’ll lose money, whereas purchasing a home is a guarantee that you’ll make money over the long-term.&nbsp;

**Here’s my home buying guarantee:** If you buy a home from me and aren’t satisfied with it after 12 months, then I’ll help you sell it for free.

\*I also have a guarantee for home sellers: If I don’t sell your home in 45 days or fewer, I’ll give you $1,500.\*
