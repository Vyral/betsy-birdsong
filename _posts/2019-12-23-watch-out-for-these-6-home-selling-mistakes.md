If you’re planning to sell your house, be sure to avoid making these six common home-selling mistakes:

**1\. Picking the wrong agent.** The right agent answers the phone when you call, communicates clearly and consistently, and will tell you the truth, not just what you want to hear.<br>**2\. Overpricing the house.** If you overprice your home when you first list it, that can be a deal-killer that could cost you time and money in the long run. Many sellers think that if they can start out high, they can always reduce the price if they don’t get any offers. I’ve seen that happen before; doing so will cause the house to take longer to sell and you’ll likely get less money for it than you would if you priced it correctly in the first place.<br>**3\. Failing to make simple repairs.** Many homeowners can’t afford or don’t have the ability to make repairs, but the simple things are the most noticeable when people come to view your house. For example, here in New Orleans, buyers don’t want to see water stains; they’ll assume there is a big leak and may lose interest. Do your best to take care of the small repairs before listing your home; they’re inexpensive but they can save you a lot of money and help your home sell quicker.

**4\. Forgetting to declutter.** I know that decluttering isn’t necessarily fun, but not doing so is a huge mistake. A cluttered home doesn’t show well in photographs and can put buyers off before they even decide to come view your home. Put unneeded possessions into storage, or else throw them out or donate them.

<br>**5\. Not allowing enough access to your home.** Buyers want to see your house when they want to see it, not when it’s convenient for you. As a home seller, your job is to make sure your home is ready to show; we can ask for a 24-hour notice from potential buyers who want to come see it, but if they’re only in town for one day, you’ll need to have it ready for them.

<br>**6\. Getting emotional.** I know that you’ve made wonderful memories in your home, and it may be sad to leave that house, but you can’t get emotional about it. If you want to sell your home, you need to be realistic about what you’ll get for it given its condition.

As a final note to my home sellers: I guarantee that if you list your house with me, I’ll have it sold within 45 days or else I’ll pay you $1,500. I’m very confident about what we do here at The Birdsong Group.
